# LPsource
A link prediction framework which considers the traditional topological measures from the state-of-the-art and 
new measures based on communities and overlapping groups information.

To build LPsource and prepare it for use, you must execute the Makefile file using the command make. This will compile 
all components of LPsource framework. After this process completes without errors, you can make use of the LPSource binary 
saved into ./bin directory.
